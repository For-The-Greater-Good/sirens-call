## Design Philosophy

These frequencies connect our modern digital piracy for food security to historical moments when humanity faced similar challenges and overcame them through collective action, technological innovation, and commitment to the greater good.

The radio metaphor itself connects to pirate radio's history of broadcasting vital information without permission - just as we aggregate and broadcast food security data today.
