# Getting Started with Pantry Pirate Radio

**Breaking down barriers to food security through unified resource access**

Pantry Pirate Radio is a distributed food security data aggregation system implementing the **OpenReferral Human Services Data Specification (HSDS) v3.1.1**. The system unifies scattered food resource data through AI-powered normalization, intelligent deduplication, and geographic optimization to provide comprehensive, HSDS-compliant food security information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **Python 3.11+** (for local development)
- An **LLM API key** (OpenAI or Claude)

## Installation

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/For-The-Greater-Good/pantry-pirate-radio.git
   cd pantry-pirate-radio
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Choose your setup method**

   ### Option A: Using Bouy (Recommended)
   ```bash
   ./bouy up --init
   ```
   
   ### Option B: Using Docker Compose
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   ### Option C: Local Development
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry run alembic upgrade head
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   # Should return: {"status": "healthy"}
   ```

</Steps>
